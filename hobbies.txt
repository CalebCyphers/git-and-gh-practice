Hobby 1: Reading. I read all the time, though usually through audiobooks, if that counts. It can really help commuting be less boring

Hobby 2: Games. I don't play a lot of video games, but I love to tinker with boardgames. Designing and testing boardgames is hugely engaging

Hobby 3: Bookbinding. Making your own books and sketchbooks is a blast if you haven't tried it. The books you make will inevitably look worse than anything you could buy from the store, but the'll be more important to you because you made them yourself.
