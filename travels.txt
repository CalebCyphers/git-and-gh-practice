Travel 1: I took a trip with my partner to Washington D.C. recently. My favorite part was seeing all the incredible museums!

Travel 2: My first trip to Disney World was when I was 22 years old. I thought that I wouldn't be impressed, since it's sort of a kid's park, but i was wrong. I was so wrong. Tons of fun.

Travel 3: I went to Las Vegas with my partner, and we did no gambling. None. We went to escape rooms, played pinball, saw the hotels, saw the blueman group, baked in the sun... it was a blast!
